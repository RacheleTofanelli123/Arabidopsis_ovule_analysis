# Analysis of cellular growth patterns shaping the Arabidopsis thaliana ovule

In this repository you will find some R script used for the analysis of cellular growth pattern that shapes the ovule of arabidopsis thaliana. The data are obtained from the 3d digital atlas of ovule published in eLife on January 2021 https://elifesciences.org/articles/63262.

The ovule is the female reproductive organ of higher plants. The ovule exhibits an elaborate tissue architecture exemplified by its multiple cell types and extreme curvature visible in the highly asymmetric growth of the two integuments, for this reason it is a suitable model system to study plant morphogenesis. 

To study ovule morphogenesis we have generated a 3D digital ovules with cellular resolution over all developmental stages. The atlas covers all stages from early primordium outgrowth to the mature pre-fertilization ovule and provides quantitative information about various cellular parameters.
